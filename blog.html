		<p class="dark">Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>
		
		<p class="dark">No one can escape from the absolute need of technology in our daily life. Every one of us is so dependent on technology that we cannot do without them. Starting from computers to keeping fit, we require technology at every step. Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use the telephones and computers to talk to them and even see them. Our daily office work is also technology based. No longer do people use the pen and paper to complete their work. We maintain our health by going to the gyms. There are machines in the gym which help us reduce our weight and keep fit. The use of technology has made our life comfortable. We cannot think of a life sans technology. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the use of technology. Thus technology is undeniably an important of our life.</p>
